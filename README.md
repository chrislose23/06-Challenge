## Important

It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a Challenge or any aspect of the curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

Ask the class Slack channel/peer support.

Office hours facilitated by your instructional staff before and after each class session.

Tutoring GuidelinesLinks to an external site.â€”schedule a session in the "Tutor Sessions" section of Bootcampspot - Canvas.

If the above resources are not applicable and you have a need, please reach out to a member of your instructional team, your Student Success Advisor, or submit a support ticket in the Student Support section of your BCS application.
