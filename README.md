Challenge #6: Build a weather app

## Description

This app is a weather app using the OpenWeather API to generate the weather conditions for a user generated search. The app allows the user to input a city and state and the weather for that input is displayed. The app saves 5 of your most recent searches and gives the user a 'quick click' option to get the weather.

The app also displays a 5-Day forecast as well!

You can save up to 5 of your most recent searches and use them as 'quick clicks' to access your weather data quickly.
